## How to Build ⬅️
### You will need a Openweathermap.org API (Free)
run `git clone https://github.com/dumpydev/weather.git`  
run `flutter pub get`  
Now add a file in /lib/ call it 'secrets.dart'       
put your key like `var apikey = 'your_api_key`   
run `flutter pub get`          
run `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`          
run `flutter build apk`             
run `adb install build/app/outputs/apk/app-release.apk`
